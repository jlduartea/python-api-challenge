This is the Homework for API Challenge in Pandas by Jose Luis Duarte


## Before to begin
1.  Check that a folder called "output_data" exists in the same location where the code for WeatherPy is, inside you will have the csv file containing the city information.

## Hints and Considerations
- Every single map, will be store in the same folder where the code is.
- Below are some the maps that will generate the two codes, VacationPy and WeatherPy

  ![Weather2](WeatherPy/Lat_Wind.png)

## Conclusions derived from the information analysis:

- Temperature appears to have a strong correlation with latitude, which implies that the climate is warmer as one approaches the equator.
- This explains why the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer at one time of the year than the northern hemisphere.
There appears to be no significant relationship between latitude and cloud cover.
- There is no important relationship between latitude and wind speed.
- Wind speeds of more than 25 mph occur in several cities in the Northern Hemisphere.
- A significant relationship between latitude and humidity was not identified even when several cities in the northern hemisphere with humidity above 65% could be identified.
